# Privacy Policy — Ghost Journal: Detect & Log

This Privacy Policy explains how **Airtech LLC (doing business as TomorrowSkies Studio)** (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles data within the mobile application **Ghost Journal: Detect & Log** (“the App”).

We respect your privacy and aim to be transparent about how information is used.  
By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### Location Data (GPS)
The App requests permission to access your device’s **location**.  
This data is used **solely for gameplay** — for example, spawning or detecting in-game entities based on your approximate position.  

- The App uses location readings **in real time** to drive in-app mechanics.  
- **No location data is transmitted, stored, or shared** with us or any third party in the current version.  
- You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, though certain features may become unavailable.

If future updates introduce optional online features (e.g., global encounter mapping), this policy will be updated and you will be prompted for consent before any transmission occurs.

### Device and Sensor Data
The App may access certain device sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer, microphone, light sensor) to simulate environmental detection.  
These readings remain **on your device** and are not transmitted or stored by us.

### Diagnostic and Usage Data
During the beta phase, Ghost Journal does **not** collect analytics, crash logs, or usage data.  
Future versions may use anonymous diagnostic data (e.g., performance, stability) to improve the App.  
If introduced, this will be clearly disclosed in this policy and within the App’s settings.

### Optional User Input
If the App allows users to record notes or journal entries, those remain local to your device and are never uploaded to our servers.

## 2. How We Use Information
We use information **only within your device** to:
- Operate gameplay features such as scanning, detection, and location-based mechanics;  
- Improve performance and ensure sensor accuracy;  
- Provide localized storage for your collected encounter data.

If analytics or advertising services are added in future updates, we will:
- Use them solely for improving user experience and performance metrics;  
- Update this policy before any such data collection begins.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Retention
All gameplay and journal data are stored locally on your device.  
We do not maintain user accounts, cloud backups, or external databases at this time.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services
Currently, the App does not integrate any third-party SDKs.  
Future releases may include analytics (such as Google Firebase) or ad services (such as AdMob).  
When added, these providers will be listed in this section and their policies linked here.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy
Ghost Journal is not directed toward children under the age of 13.  
We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If you believe a minor has used the App and provided information, please contact us at [support@tomorrowskies.com](mailto:support@tomorrowskies.com) for removal assistance.

---

## 6. Your Rights and Choices
You may:
- Delete local data at any time by uninstalling the App;  
- Decline or revoke location and sensor permissions;  
- Contact us for clarification about future data handling.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves.  
The “Last Updated” date above reflects the latest revision.  
Material changes will be announced in the App or on our official website.
